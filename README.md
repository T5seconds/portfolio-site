<h2>Hello, my name is Michael.</h2>

This is my portfolio website where I will have projects I work on. Please feel free to message me if you have any questions or comments on the website. This is the first website I've built on my own in react, and there are many wizards out there who I know have a cleaner way. 

It's also a massive work in progress, and while I hope any part of it might be useful for you, it still needs to be finished and then refactored. 

Shoot me a message at mvolkovin@gmail.com if you have work or are looking to collab (check my README).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Much thanks to the Met](https://metmuseum.github.io/) for their API and the open source progammers who makes this stuff possible.
